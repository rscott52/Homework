      <p>
      Hello! My name is Ryan and I am 28 years old. I am a US Army Veteran, and I am currently attending a 12-week bootcamp for web development.
      <br> Today, I am currently trying to figure out how to properly use CSS for my week 4 Homework assignment and it is a nightmare!<br>I am not giving up, however!
      Practice makes perfect, so I got this!
