<p id="p1">
  Hello! My name is Ryan and I am 28 years old. I am a US Army Veteran, and I am currently attending a 12-week bootcamp for web development. Today,
  I am currently trying to figure out how to properly use CSS for my week 4 Homework assignment and it is a nightmare! I am not giving up, however!
  Practice makes perfect, so I got this!
